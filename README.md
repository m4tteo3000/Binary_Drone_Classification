We explored whether synthetic drone imagery could effectively supplement limited real-world data when training simple CNN models to accurately classify drone types. 

We generated synthetic images using Blender, supplemented them with Kaggle drone footage, and trained CNNs from scratch, also implementing transfer learning. We compared these approaches with SVMs.
